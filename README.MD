**Standard Piano Roll Interface**

The primary UI facilitates the same standard piano roll note editing found in most modern notation software. Enabling independent modification of pitch, timing, duration, and velocity. Notes can be added, deleted, elongated or shortened. Any user familiar with a piano roll editor will be instantly at home.

**Advanced Velocity Editor**

The Advanced Velocity Editor enables unprecedented command over a composition's dynamics. More than just offering fine-grained control over individual note dynamics, tools like the Dynamics Curve Tool (for three-point cubic Bezier curves), the Freehand Draw Tool (for freely drawing dynamic curves by hand), the Mathematical Formula Input Tool (for equation based shaping), and the Classic Shapes Tool (triangle, oval, polygon, invert shape, and more); offer complete command over any selection of notes' dynamic landscape. Want a mathematically precise 20-bar crescendo, the tools provide it. Want a mathematically correct
$y(t) = 20 \cdot \sin(\pi t)$
sine wave, the tools provide it.
