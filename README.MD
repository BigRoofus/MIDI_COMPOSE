mico, pronounced "mee-ko," short for MIDI_COMPOSE, is a MIDI sequencing and editing application designed for comprehensive musical data manipulation.

**Real-Time Processing Architecture**

mico uses a real-time, continuous processing model that moves away from traditional, menu-driven workflows. All features, including analysis, transformations, and generative functions, run in the background as dynamic filters that provide real-time suggestions and modifications to the MIDI data. This creates a WYSIWYG environment and a live feedback loop, giving users immediate visual feedback and allowing them to instantly decide whether to apply computational results to the score.

**Advanced Velocity Editor** 

A completely new and revolutionary Velocity Editor gives you more than just fine-grained control over individual note dynamics. The Advanced Velocity Editor provides a much more imaginative and comprehensive approach to dynamics. With tools like the Dynamics Curve Tool for three-point cubic Bezier curve editing, the Freehand Draw Tool for drawing any dynamic curve by hand, the Mathematical Formula Input Tool for entering precise math, and the Classic Shapes Tool (triangle, oval, polygon, invert shape...), the Advanced Velocity Editor gives you next level control over your composition's dynamics. Want a mathematically precise 20 bar crescendo? You got it. Want a mathematically correct 
$y(t) = 20 \cdot \sin(\pi t)$ 
sine wave? You got it.

**Advanced Grid System** 

The Advanced Grid is a powerful visual tool for precise note placement. It can be configured to any time signature or meter—including standard, complex, odd, and mixed—and its tempo can be freely adjusted without affecting your original MIDI file's structure or playback. If you ever lose track of your initial grid settings, a convenient reset button instantly restores them to the state they were in when you opened the file.

**Standard Piano Roll Interface**

The primary UI facilitates the same standard direct note editing featured in most modern DAWs, enabling users to independently modify pitch, timing, duration, and velocity. Notes can be added, deleted, or adjusted by their start and end points. Any user familiar with piano roll software will be instantly at home.

**VST Integration** 

The application supports real-time audio playback through Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instruments (e.g., Kontakt, Spitfire LABS). However, it does not support the import, export, or editing of audio files.
