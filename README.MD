mico, pronounced "mee-ko," short for MIDI_COMPOSE, is a MIDI sequencing and editing application designed for engineering comprehensive musical data manipulation.

**Real-Time Processing Architecture**

The application uses a real-time, continuous processing model that moves away from traditional, menu-driven workflows. All features, including analysis, transformations, and generative functions, run in the background as dynamic filters that provide real-time suggestions and modifications to the MIDI data. This creates a WYSIWYG environment and a live feedback loop, giving users immediate visual feedback and allowing them to instantly decide whether to apply computational results to the score.

**Customizable Grid System** 

A visual grid aids in the precise placement of notes. This grid can be configured to standard, complex, odd, and mixed meters, including a comprehensive list of time signatures, without affecting MIDI playback.

**VST Integration** 

The application supports real-time audio playback through Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instruments (e.g., Kontakt, Spitfire LABS). However, it does not support the import, export, or editing of audio files.

**Standard Piano Roll Interface**

The primary UI facilitates direct note editing, enabling users to independently modify pitch, timing, duration, and velocity. Notes can be added, deleted, or adjusted by their start and end points. Any user familiar with piano roll software will be instantly at home.

**Advanced Velocity Editor** 

A dedicated, synchronized Velocity Editor provides fine-grained control over note dynamics. Bezeir curve type tools allow the user to make precise dynamic adjustments over time.  Want a mathematically precise 20 bar crescendo? You got it. Want a mathemtcially correct 
$y(t) = 20 \cdot \sin(\pi t)$ 
sine wave for your dynamics? You got it.
