mico, pronounced "mee-ko," short for MIDI_COMPOSE, is a MIDI sequencing and editing application designed for comprehensive musical data manipulation.

**Real-Time Processing Architecture**

mico uses a real-time, continuous processing model that moves away from traditional, menu-driven workflows. All features, including analysis, transformations, and generative functions, run in the background as dynamic filters that provide real-time suggestions and modifications to the MIDI data. This creates a WYSIWYG environment and a live feedback loop, giving users immediate visual feedback and allowing them to instantly decide whether to apply computational results to the score.

**Advanced Velocity Editor** 

A completely new and revolutionary Velocity Editor gives you more than just fine-grained control over note by note dynamics. The mico Velocity Editor provides a much more imaginative and comprehensive approach, giving you extreme control. With a Dynamics Curve tool with three-point (cubic Bezier) curve editing, a Freehand Draw tool, and a Classic Shapes tool with default shapes such as triangle, oval, polygon, inverted shape, etc., you can now create precise, complex, and mathematically correct dynamic adjustments over any length of time. Want a mathematically precise 20 bar crescendo? You got it. Want a mathematically correct 
$y(t) = 20 \cdot \sin(\pi t)$ 
sine wave? You got it.

**Advanced Grid System** 

A visual grid that helps with the precise placement of notes, Advanced Grid can be configured to standard, complex, odd, and mixed meters, including any possible time signature, with a starting point that can be freely shifted anywhere, intra-bar or not, and these changes never effect the structure of the original midi file, or affect MIDI playback. If you have you been working on something for so long that you forgot what Grid setting the composition initially had, never fear, there is a reset button that allows you to instantly go back to the Grid settings that existed when you opend the midid file.

**Standard Piano Roll Interface**

The primary UI facilitates the same standard direct note editing featured in most modern DAWs, enabling users to independently modify pitch, timing, duration, and velocity. Notes can be added, deleted, or adjusted by their start and end points. Any user familiar with piano roll software will be instantly at home.  Also, the user can drag over a selection of notes, and then alter the length of them using the GUI.

**VST Integration** 

The application supports real-time audio playback through Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instruments (e.g., Kontakt, Spitfire LABS). However, it does not support the import, export, or editing of audio files.
