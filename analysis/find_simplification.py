# This feature atomizes a complete MIDI file, extracting the 
# musical "DNA" from complex arrangements. This process is based 
# on established principles of classical music theory. The goal 
# is to identify and save the underlying structural and 
# developmental patterns, not the specific notes, pitches, or 
# rhythms, so they can be applied to new compositions. This 
# "DNA" if saved, will be saved as JSON.
