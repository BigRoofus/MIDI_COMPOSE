# More than just aligning notes to the gird at 100%, this quantize feature is smart.
# Often in a MIDI recording taken from live playing most of the notes will be fine.
# It may be only 5% or less that are off in timing.
# This tool can analyze the surrounding notes and
# identify "rhythmic grooves" so to speak,
# so it knows which notes are close enough in time, and which ones are really off.

# The tool also has a % setting, where the user can adjust an amount from
# 1 to 100.  0 being no effect of quantization at all,
# 100 being complete quantization.

# As well as being intelligent and being able to find only the notes that are off time,
# the tool also has the standard "quantize to exact note length" options.
# It should have all the same note lengths that the grid can have:

# "The piano roll should feature a gird representing a user switchable note value, 
# such as one bar (whole note), 1/4 note, 18th note, etc.  The grid also can be 
# switched to complex, odd, and mixed meters. The grid is just a visual aid however,
# it shouldn't change the way the notes are played no matter what meter you set the grid to."
