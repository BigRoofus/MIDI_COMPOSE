# The entire scope of this module is not decided yet,
# but this module will be used for generating fugues from 
# a selected series of notes, AKA, a motif.

# The user can drag across a single track of MIDI for any length,
# then use this function to generate a fugue from it.

# After generation, the resulting fugue should open up
# in a new tab as a new composition.

# Perhaps using some kind of visual tree GUI system would
# work well here, with some kind of visual or graphical programming approach.
# Not sure what all other options I want to include, but it should be 
# deep and through and complete.
# I want Bach to be jealous if he used it.
# I want composers with multiple PHDs in counterpoint to be jealous of it.
