# This feature intelligently simplifies MIDI by reducing note density 
# and merging consecutive notes. It allows users to specify a target rhythmic 
# resolution, such as converting a passage with 64th notes into 16th notes. 
# The tool also automatically combines short, repeated notes on the same 
# staff into a single, longer note to create a smoother and more 
# streamlined musical line.
