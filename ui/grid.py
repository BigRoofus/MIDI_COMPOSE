Advanced Grid System

The Advanced Grid is a powerful visual tool for precise note placement. 
It can be configured to any time signature or meter, including standard, 
complex, odd, and mixed. Its tempo can be freely adjusted without 
affecting the original MIDI file's structure or playback. The initial 
grid time signature remains active in the background, visible but 
uneditable. Users can change it manually by navigating to the settings menu.
