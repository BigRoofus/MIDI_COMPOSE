# The user experience for MIDI Compose is built around a sleek, dark-gray 
# GUI that's designed to be easy on the eyes, presented in a low-contrast 
# environment that's perfect for long editing sessions. The layout is fully 
# responsive, with all elements seamlessly adjusting to the size of the 
# window as the user resize it.

# For navigating and editing compositions, the user will use a combination 
# of mouse and keyboard controls. The primary method is with the mouse, 
# where the user can simply drag to select notes before applying a transformation 
# or analysis from the menu bar at the top, which features options like File, 
# Edit, Transform, and Analyze.

# For more precise edits, the user can use keyboard shortcuts. The arrow keys 
# allow for fine-tuned adjustments, while combining them with the Shift 
# key gives the user more powerful control. For example, Shift + Left/Right moves 
# a selected note by one rhythmic increment, and Shift + Up/Down shifts it 
# a full octave.
