Advanced Velocity Editor

A completely new and revolutionary Velocity Editor gives you more than 
just fine-grained control over individual note dynamics. The Advanced 
Velocity Editor provides a much more imaginative and comprehensive 
approach. With tools like the Dynamics Curve Tool for three-point 
cubic Bezier curve editing, the Freehand Draw Tool for drawing any 
dynamic curve by hand, the Mathematical Formula Input Tool for entering 
precise math, and the Classic Shapes Tool (triangle, oval, polygon, 
invert shape...), the Advanced Velocity Editor gives you next level 
control over your composition's dynamics. Want a mathematically precise 
20 bar crescendo? You got it. Want a mathematically correct 
$y(t) = 20 \cdot \sin(\pi t)$ 
sine wave? You got it.
