Advanced Velocity Editor

The Advanced Velocity Editor gives the user unprecedented command over a 
composition's dynamics. More than just offering fine-grained control 
over individual note dynamics, tools like the Dynamics Curve Tool 
(for three-point cubic Bezier curves), the Freehand Draw Tool (for 
freely drawing dynamic curves), the Mathematical Formula Input Tool 
(for equation-based shaping), and the Classic Shapes Tool (triangle, 
oval, polygon, invert shape, and more) give the user complete command 
over any selections's dynamic landscape. If the user wants a 
mathematically precise 20-bar crescendo, the tools provide it. 
If the user wants a mathematically correct y ( t ) = 20 ⋅ sin ⁡ ( π t ) 
sine wave, the tools provide it.
